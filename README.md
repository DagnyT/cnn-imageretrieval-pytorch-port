This repository contains model and weights from paper "[Fine-tuning CNN Image Retrieval with No Human Annotation](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~radenfil/publications/Radenovic-TPAMI18.pdf)", ResNet101 fine-tuned network with GeM pooling and contrastive loss, ported from MatConvNet to Pytorch. Transfer was done with the help of [pytorch-mcn - tool for importing trained MatConvNet models into Pytorch](https://github.com/albanie/pytorch-mcn).

In order to run the script, please, download weights from [the Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l34OJrHueu_1ZKVNl_IbX4PlbV4f-1Ue) and store them in the weights folder.
